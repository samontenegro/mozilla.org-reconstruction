<!--

This is a very simple mockup of the Mozilla home page built as an alternative mini-project for The Odin Project's Web Design 101 curriculum.

I say "alternative" because, normally, the redone website is either the Google home page or the Google Search Results page. This is actually indicated in the assignment, but I misread and thought I could redo *any* website I wanted. Mozilla's looked simple, clean and pretty, and immediately set up a repo with "Mozilla" all over it. 

This will *not* have media queries, any JS, or extremely fancy things. However, I'll try to keep the look and animations as close to the original as possible with the skills I currently possess. I'll also try to make the website "fluid", but without media queries, it'll certainly *not* be responsive.
